### August Peak Hours

We explored peak hours for the time period August 2019. Number of rides were sorted by each hour of the day.

The two peaks of usage was between hours 7 and 10 (7:00 am to 10:00 am) and hours 16 and 19 (4:00 pm and 7:00 pm).
Om contrast, the low point of usage was between hours 0 and 5 (12:00 am to 5:00 am).

### Top Starting Location

We plotted the density usage of starting location rides on a map of New York City. The larger and darker the color dot, the higher the density usage.

We found that many rides are started from locations such as Manhattan and the Empire State Building, with less usage around areas such as Greenpoint and Williamsburg.

### Checkout Times for Users

We visualized the distribution of bike rides by plotting how many bikes were rented for a certain time against the length of a ride by minutes.

We saw that the average trip length was approxiamately 5 minutes. The vast majority of rides were less than 30 minutes.

### Checkout Times by Gender

We visualized the distribution of bike rides by plotting how many bikes were rented for a certain time against the length of a ride by minutes, but this time we broke it down by gender. 

We found that those who identify as men are the majority of our riders, with their average ride being approxiamately 5 minutes.
Those who identified as women were our next largest group, whose average ride was approxiamately 6 minutes.
Our last group was the collection of people whose indentified gender was not known. Their average time seemed to be between 5 and 25 minutes.
